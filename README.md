# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

A challenge from The Odin Project

##Introduction

This is the first challenge from The Odin Project's Foundations Javascript section.

The task was to be completed in 2 stages:

- Create a console based game only.
- Add a user interface to the game and utilise event listerners to take user input.

As a complete JavaScript newbie at the time, I thought this would have been more difficult than it was - a testiment to the quality of materials provided by TOP. As the first challenge, I took the opportunity to use as many of the concepts I'd learned as possible to help with embedding that knowledge.

##Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 using Sass
- JavaScript
