As a total JS newbie, I thought this would be more difficult than it was. I probably could have made the code a bit simpler but I wanted to use as many of the features I've learened over the past 4 days to help embed them.

The game works as intended, which I'm pleased about, but I'll look forward to the time when I can give this thing an interface so it doesn't have to be played in the browser only.
